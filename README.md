# Capsule Network-based Lymph Node Detection in CT Images

## Project Overview

This research project focuses on developing an advanced method for detecting lymph nodes in Computed Tomography (CT) images using Capsule Networks. The proposed approach aims to assist clinicians in easily identifying lymph nodes, potentially improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses.

## Objectives

1. Develop a deep learning model using Capsule Networks for lymph node detection in CT images.
2. Compare the performance of Capsule Networks with traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this task.
3. Provide comprehensive analysis and visualizations of the results.
4. Create a user-friendly tool for clinicians to utilize this technology in practice.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Enhanced understanding of lymph node structures and CT imaging techniques.
2. Practical experience with CNN-based deep learning networks.
3. Implementation and analysis of Capsule Networks for medical image processing.
4. Proficiency in using various tools and libraries:
   - Data manipulation: Pandas
   - Visualization: Matplotlib
   - Medical imaging: ITK, MITK, RadiantViewer, 3D Slicer, ImageJ
5. Development of a method to assist clinicians in lymph node detection using CT images.
6. Comprehensive statistical analysis of the results.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning implementations)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- ITK, MITK (for medical image processing)
- RadiantViewer, 3D Slicer, ImageJ (for medical image viewing and analysis)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lymph-node-detection.git
   cd lymph-node-detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   - ### For Mac/Linux
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   - ### For Windows
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   ### NOTE: Make sure to have venv package installed (if not, try "pip install virtualenv", type pip3 for mac/linux)

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Download the necessary datasets and place them in the `data/raw/` directory.
